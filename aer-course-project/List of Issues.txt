List of Issues:
===

Planner takes too long (cannot reporduce issue. Try all gate combos?)
- Problem sequence:         gates_ordered = [gate2,gate1,gate4,gate3]
        gates_ordered = [gate2,gate1,gate3,gate4]
        [gate3,gate2,gate,gate4]


Gates out of order not working (Aggressive traj issue, obstacle avoidance problems, planning problems)

Should try smoothing RRT star waypoints

Add a straight Piecewise Trajectory to the gate sections (ie stop in front of gates before moving through)
Iteration Counter (sometimes doesn't increment, sometimes skips an iteration) [DONE]
