List of Issues:
===

Planner takes too long (cannot reporduce issue. Try all gate combos?) [DONE]
Iteration Counter (sometimes doesn't increment, sometimes skips an iteration) [DONE]
Add a straight Piecewise Trajectory to the gate sections [CANCELLED]
RESTORE CODE [DONE]
Straight line Traj Tracker [DONE]

Stop in front of gates before moving through (doesn't always work b/c you cannot predict timing of splits)
Pruning RRT* to use fewer straight lines [DONE]

[!!] Slow down the drone when passing through gates
[TROUBLE] 3214 order is bad! 4213 is also bad! 1423 [SOLVED]
[Bonus] Velocity profiles for trajectories

- NEW ISSUES: 
-- Waypoints getting unintentionally deleted if they fall between front and back.
-- Planning takes too long when collision_tolerance = 0.1. Maybe adjust gate sizes?
