List of Issues:
===

Planner takes too long (cannot reporduce issue. Try all gate combos?) [DONE]
- Problem sequence:         gates_ordered = [gate2,gate1,gate4,gate3]
        gates_ordered = [gate2,gate1,gate3,gate4]
        [gate3,gate2,gate,gate4]

Straight line Traj Tracker [DONE]
Pruning RRT* to use fewer straight lines [DONE]
- NEW ISSUES: 
-- Colision checking is acting up again ...
-- Waypoints getting unintentionally deleted if they fall between front and back.
Add a straight Piecewise Trajectory to the gate sections [CANCELLED] [Current implementation is "close enough"]
Slow down the drone when passing through gates [Done?] [Constant speed]
FIX CODE [DONE]

Stop in front of gates before moving through (doesn't always work b/c you cannot predict timing of splits)
Iteration Counter (sometimes doesn't increment, sometimes skips an iteration) [DONE]
