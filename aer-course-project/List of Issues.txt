List of Issues:
===

Planner takes too long (cannot reporduce issue. Try all gate combos?) [DONE]
Iteration Counter (sometimes doesn't increment, sometimes skips an iteration) [DONE]
Add a straight Piecewise Trajectory to the gate sections [CANCELLED]
RESTORE CODE [DONE]
Straight line Traj Tracker [DONE]

Stop in front of gates before moving through (doesn't always work b/c you cannot predict timing of splits)
Pruning RRT* to use fewer straight lines [DONE]
- NEW ISSUES: 
-- Colision checking is acting up again ...
-- Waypoints getting unintentionally deleted if they fall between front and back.

[!!] Slow down the drone when passing through gates
[TROUBLE] 3214 order is bad! 4213 is also bad! 1423
